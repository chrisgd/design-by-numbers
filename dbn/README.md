Design by Numbers (DBN)
===
TL;DR: For documentation of the language, go to: https://docs.racket-lang.org/dbn-manual/index.html.
This on the other hand, is the source repository, mostly useful if you're contributing
or reporting bugs. 

Design by Numbers (DBN) is both a language and a book by John Maeda that was created to 
help people who were artists and designers understand how to code and the purpose behind 
coding. The language itself is simple with very few commands in an effort to make it easy 
to remember the syntax.

Today, finding working versions of DBN can be challenging so we created a version that 
runs on top of the Racket ecosystem. To use this, you can download Racket (http://racket-lang.org) 
and go to File | Package Manager. From here, you can download and install 
design-by-numbers (this repository) and you can use the language by putting #lang racket 
at the top of your file.
